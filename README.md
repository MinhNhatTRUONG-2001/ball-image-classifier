An image classifier model that distinguishes six different ball types used in six sports.
## Image Dataset
Download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hB3zzjvQc3nrz2_TAo_ptPs9YznYEIzr?usp=drive_link). Then put the `ball-images` folder at the root of this repository.

The six subfolders are taken from this dataset on Kaggle:

## Personal note
In this commit, the code trains a model with the test accuracy is around 65%. I will try to improve the accuracy to above 70% or even 80%. Perhaps I will try implementing data augmentation in the future.
